## About me

Hello world! I am a biomechanical machine which converts coffee into software.

## About this webpage

This site was created in January 2021, as part of an assignment for CS 4720 Internet Programming at [Kennesaw State University](https://www.kennesaw.edu/)</a>. It is an example of a personal webpage, containing hand-written HTML5 and CSS code. The subpages on this website contain code for other assignments done for this class.

In April 2021, the site was completely rewritten using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a really good static site generator.
